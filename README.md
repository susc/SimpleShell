# SimpleShell

This is a simple Shell implemented in C language, aimed at helping users understand the basic working principles of Shell. It can execute internal commands (e.g., `help`, `exit`) and external commands (e.g., `ls`, `cd`) and supports pipe (e.g., `ls | less`).

## Features

- Easy-to-understand code for learning purposes
- Implements basic command-line functionality
- Easy to extend and add more command-line functionality

## How to use

After downloading the project, run the following command in the command line:

```shell
gcc main.c -o main
```

Then, you can run the generated executable file:

```shell
./main
```

You can now execute basic command-line operations in the Shell! Type `help` and press enter to output the help information for this Shell, and type `exit` and press enter to exit the program.
